# English Speaking Practice

Hello! Thanks for visiting here to learn a little bit about me. I'm just a normal guy who has discovered a few ways to improve my spoken English without going abroad. I created this channel to help people get similar results. Don't get me wrong! I don't speak English like native speakers. But whenever I speak English in public, other people usually turn their heads to look at me, thinking that I must have lived in the USA for many years (I haven't).

Listening is a great way to improve your English. When we were babies, we learned our native language by listening to people around us. So, the best way to improve your English is to listen to as much English as possible.

**Learn English Through Stories**! I aim to provide you with the best stories that are both short and easy to listen to, so you won't have any problem understanding them. This is going to help you develop your listening skills as well as your comprehension skills and vocabulary.

Good luck!
