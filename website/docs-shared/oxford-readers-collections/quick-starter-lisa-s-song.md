## Description

Learn English through the story with subtitles: Lisa's Song ( Quick Starter )

### ❖ Brief:

Al Brown plays the guitar in a band with friends. He writes songs, too. 'Our boy can't live without his music, his parents say. But when Al's baby sister, Lisa, arrives from hospital, his life is suddenly different. Now his mother and father have no time for him, and he has no time for school work - or the band. Then Al's sister gets ill. And Grandad tells him, 'Write a song for Lisa!' But why, and how can this help?
