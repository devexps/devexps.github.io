## Description

Learn English through the story with subtitles: Perseus ( Quick Starter )

### ❖ Brief:

Perseus is the son of Danae, Princess of Argos, and the god Zeus. When he is very young, his mother moves with him to live on the island of Seriphos. Later, Polydectes - the king of Seriphos - wants to marry Danae. Perseus says no to this, so Polydectes sends the young man away for the head of Medusa. Medusa is a she-monster, with snakes for hair. Can Perseus find and kill Medusa? And what happens after he goes back to Seriphos?
