### ❖ Brief:

'Be careful with Morfran,' Princess Adhan tells her young son, Merlin. Morfran, the son of the Enchantress Ceridwen, is a bully. Then one day, Merlin drinks one of Ceridwen's magic potions. After this, he can become different animals, see through walls, change the weather, and look into the future. But Morfran is angry with Merlin when Ceridwen dies. Years later, Morfran - now King Vortigern's magician - plans to kill Merlin, the boy with no father. How can Merlin's magic powers help him to fight his old enemy?
