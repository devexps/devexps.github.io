Thanks for visiting here to learn a little bit about me. I&#x27;m just a normal guy who has discovered a few ways to improve my spoken English without going abroad. I created this website to help people get similar results.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-story">My story<a href="#my-story" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to My story" title="Direct link to My story">​</a></h2><p>One day in October 2012, I was having a phone call in English with a French guy (My job required me to speak English from time to time). I couldn&#x27;t communicate well. At one point during the call, I wanted to ask the guy a simple question, but I couldn&#x27;t do it. I didn&#x27;t know how to form a question in English! After the call, I felt terrible because I had been trying to improve my spoken English for a long time (about 2 years and 6 months), but I still wasn&#x27;t happy with the results.</p><p>I didn&#x27;t want to be perfect. I just wanted to communicate well enough to do my job. But I didn&#x27;t know what to do. The problem was that I lived in a country that all my friends and colleagues spoke in our mother&#x27;s language. And I didn&#x27;t have a speaking partner to practice with. But I wanted to speak English well. There were a few people in my company who could speak English well. These people had lived in English-speaking countries for many years at some point in their lives.</p><p>I was jealous of these people. I wanted to speak English like them. So, I tried hard... I started to get serious about improving my speaking. And then…five months later, I realized that my spoken English had improved quite a lot! But that was quite some time ago. Today, I can now speak English even better.</p><p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong! I don&#x27;t speak English like native speakers. But whenever I speak English in public, other people usually turn their heads to look at me, thinking that I must have lived in the USA for many years (I haven&#x27;t). Enough story about me. Now, let&#x27;s talk about you. If you&#x27;re still here, I assume you want to speak English well too.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-did-i-do--what-do-you-can-do">What did I do &amp; what do you can do?<a href="#what-did-i-do--what-do-you-can-do" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What did I do &amp; what do you can do?" title="Direct link to What did I do &amp; what do you can do?">​</a></h2><p>I&#x27;m going to reveal how you can speak English better than 95% of all the other English students. I used this exactly strategy myself to become fluent in English. And no, you don’t need to live in an English-speaking country or find English speakers to talk to.</p><p>Here&#x27;s how:</p><ul><li>Step 1: Improve Your Speaking Skills with English Speaking Lessons.</li><li>Step 2: Expand Your Speaking Vocabulary with the Imitation Technique.</li><li>Finally: Become Fluent in English.</li></ul><p>The strategy has only two steps:</p><ul><li>Step 1: Use English speaking lessons to practice speaking skills such as…<ul><li>Forming statements with proper sentence structure.</li><li>Asking questions with proper sentence structure.</li><li>Telling stories.</li><li>Expressing ideas.</li><li>Giving long speeches.</li><li>Etc.</li></ul></li><li>Step 2: After your speaking skills have improved, start using the Imitation technique to expand your &quot;speaking vocabulary&quot; (The words you can use when speaking). Practice with this technique until you satisfied with your spoken English.</li></ul><p>That&#x27;s all you need to do to speak fluent English! I was able to accomplish all that because I improved my spoken English using the strategy I just shared. And you can speak English well if you use the same strategy.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-get-started">How to get started?<a href="#how-to-get-started" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to get started?" title="Direct link to How to get started?">​</a></h2><p>Want to use this strategy to improve your own speaking? If yes, I have known an English speaking course that can help you do that. It’s designed to help you become a fluent English speaker using strategy you just learned. The course is called Effortless English (Learn To Speak Like A Native).</p><p>This newly updated edition consists of four modules:</p><ul><li>Module 1 - Making clearly accent (Pronunciation)</li><li>Module 2 – Mastering the Basics (Original)</li><li>Module 3 – Advanced Training (Power)</li><li>Module 4 – Becoming Fluent in English (VIP Program)</li></ul><p>After complete these modules, you’ll know exactly how to expand your speaking vocabulary and become a fluent English speaker.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="improve-spoken-english-without-speaking-partner">Improve Spoken English Without Speaking Partner<a href="#improve-spoken-english-without-speaking-partner" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Improve Spoken English Without Speaking Partner" title="Direct link to Improve Spoken English Without Speaking Partner">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>The Best Method of Learning English by AJ Hoge - Learn Naturally and Playfully Like a Child.</p></blockquote><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="start-improving-your-pronunciation">Start Improving Your Pronunciation!<a href="#start-improving-your-pronunciation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Start Improving Your Pronunciation!" title="Direct link to Start Improving Your Pronunciation!">​</a></h3><p>Unfortunately, most English Pronunciation courses use very old methods.</p><p>Most pronunciation courses only teach you how to make individual sounds in English. For example, you might learn how to make the /r/ and the /l/ sound.</p><p>But that’s not enough. Simply practicing single sounds will NOT help you develop a perfect accent.</p><p>With the Effortless Pronunciation 5 Step Training method, you TRAIN like an athlete. You develop the skill of excellent pronunciation.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="improve-your-english-speaking-even-if-youre-still-a-beginner">Improve your English speaking even if you&#x27;re still a beginner<a href="#improve-your-english-speaking-even-if-youre-still-a-beginner" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Improve your English speaking even if you&#x27;re still a beginner" title="Direct link to Improve your English speaking even if you&#x27;re still a beginner">​</a></h3><p>Most people never learn never learn, so they continue making some mistakes again and again.</p><p>They take a lot of English classes,... doing a lot of drills, exercises, dialogues, and class activities...</p><p>Or, they try to improve alone... studying endless grammar books, vocabulary lists, textbooks, sample TOEFL tests,...</p><p>The problem with both of these methods? They don&#x27;t work - They are NOT successful. They are expensive. They are slow and boring...</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="speak-english-powerfully-and-fluently">Speak English powerfully and fluently<a href="#speak-english-powerfully-and-fluently" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Speak English powerfully and fluently" title="Direct link to Speak English powerfully and fluently">​</a></h3><p>Now is the time for you to speak English confidently. Study these powerful English lessons and improve your English speaking!</p><p>With Power English lessons, when used daily, makes you understand and speak English more powerfully? When you use the Mini-Story lessons every day, you improve your speaking and listening speed by answering simple questions as quickly as possible.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="if-you-dont-understand-you-will-learn-nothing">If you don&#x27;t understand you will learn nothing<a href="#if-you-dont-understand-you-will-learn-nothing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to If you don&#x27;t understand you will learn nothing" title="Direct link to If you don&#x27;t understand you will learn nothing">​</a></h3><p>Success with English starts inside you. You must FEEL strong every time you speak English. When you feel strong and powerful you notice that everything improves.</p><p>Other people become VERY interested in you. They listen to you. They want to hear your ideas and opinions. They respect you. You also notice that you speak faster,.. and you speak more clearly.</p><p>Unfortunately, strong positive emotion is not automatic.
